                    JACK THE WALKER - TRAINING FLOW
================================================================================

SIMPLE VERSION: How Jack Gets Smarter
--------------------------------------

[You] → Run: py ProgressiveLearning.py
   ↓
[System] → Check: Does checkpoints/latest.pt exist?
   ↓
   ├─ NO  → Start fresh (Episode 0)
   │         Jack knows nothing
   │
   └─ YES → Load checkpoint
             Jack remembers everything from last time!
   ↓
[Jack] → Try to stand in Humanoid-v5 simulation
   ↓
   ├─ Falls over → Get negative reward → Learn: "Don't do that"
   │
   └─ Stays upright → Get positive reward → Learn: "Do more of this!"
   ↓
[System] → Episode complete! Train neural network on this experience
   ↓
[Jack] → Now slightly smarter for next episode
   ↓
[Repeat] → 100 episodes later...
   ↓
[System] → Save checkpoint to checkpoints/latest.pt
             (Jack's brain is saved!)
   ↓
[Continue] → Train another 100 episodes...
   ↓
[System] → Save checkpoint again (overwrite old one)
   ↓
[Forever] → Keep training, Jack keeps getting smarter!

CHECKPOINT SYSTEM: How Knowledge is Saved
================================================================================

checkpoints/latest.pt contains:
  ┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
  │  Neural Network Weights (~600MB)        │  ← Jack's "brain"
  │  - How to balance                       │
  │  - How to move legs                     │
  │  - How to recover from falls            │
  │  - All learned behaviors                │
  ├─────────────────────────────────────────┤
  │  Training State                         │
  │  - Current episode number               │
  │  - Best reward achieved                 │
  │  - Current training stage               │
  │  - Optimizer state                      │
  └─────────────────────────────────────────┘

When you restart training:
  1. Load this file
  2. Jack remembers everything
  3. Continue from last episode
  4. Get even smarter!

WHY TRAININGJACK IS NOT NEEDED
================================================================================

Two Ways to Train Robots:
--------------------------

Option 1: REINFORCEMENT LEARNING (What we use)
  ┌───────────────────────────────────┐
  │ ProgressiveLearning.py            │
  │                                   │
  │ Jack tries random actions         │
  │ → Falls over (bad reward)         │
  │ → Learns: avoid this              │
  │                                   │
  │ Jack tries different actions      │
  │ → Stays upright (good reward)     │
  │ → Learns: do this more            │
  │                                   │
  │ Result: Learns through experience │
  └───────────────────────────────────┘
  ✅ Works with just simulation
  ✅ No demonstration data needed
  ✅ Good for locomotion


Option 2: BEHAVIOR CLONING (TrainingJack - disabled)
  ┌───────────────────────────────────┐
  │ TrainingJack.py                   │
  │                                   │
  │ Needs: Human demonstrations       │
  │ → Videos of expert behavior       │
  │ → Motion capture data             │
  │ → 5-10GB+ of data                 │
  │                                   │
  │ Jack copies expert actions        │
  │ Result: Learns by imitation       │
  └───────────────────────────────────┘
  ❌ Needs demonstration datasets
  ❌ We don't have these
  ❌ Not needed for basic training


================================================================================
EPISODE LIFECYCLE: What Happens in 1 Episode
================================================================================

Episode Start (e.g., Episode 42)
  ↓
1. Reset simulation
   - Jack spawns in standing position
   - All velocities = 0
   ↓
2. Get observation (348 numbers)
   - Joint positions
   - Joint velocities
   - Body orientation
   - etc.
   ↓
3. Jack's brain decides action (17 numbers)
   - How much to move each joint
   ↓
4. Execute action in simulation
   - Physics engine runs
   - Jack moves
   ↓
5. Get reward
   - Standing upright? +1
   - Correct height? +1
   - Fell down? -10
   - Used too much energy? -0.001 * action²
   ↓
6. Store this experience
   - Observation
   - Action
   - Reward
   ↓
7. Check: Episode done?
   - Fell over? → YES, done
   - 1000 steps? → YES, done
   - Otherwise → Go back to step 2
   ↓
8. Episode complete!
   ↓
9. Train neural network on ALL experiences from this episode
   - Update weights
   - Jack is now slightly smarter
   ↓
10. Start next episode (Episode 43)
    - Jack uses updated brain
    - Hopefully performs better!

SharedTrainingData.py
  → For saving episode data
  → No longer used (removed)

  ❌ DELETE THIS!


================================================================================
SUMMARY: What You Need to Know
================================================================================

1. Run: py ProgressiveLearning.py
2. Wait: Jack trains (100s of episodes)
3. Checkpoint saves automatically every 100 episodes
4. Interrupt anytime: Progress is saved
5. Restart: Jack continues from last checkpoint
6. Repeat: Jack keeps getting smarter!

That's it! Everything else is automatic.

TrainingJack? Not needed.
Training data? Delete it.
Multiple checkpoints? Only latest.pt matters.
Manual saves? Automatic every 100 episodes.

Just run the script and watch Jack learn! 🤖
