# Decisions resolved by bakeoff

Written by experiments/bakeoff.py. Losing arms are recorded on purpose: a decision whose alternatives were discarded cannot be re-opened when the evidence changes, and the alternatives get silently reinvented later.

> **2026-08-09 — nine `TEST` entries removed.** They were unit-test
> fixtures, not decisions: `_append_decision` took no path argument, so
> `bakeoff.py`'s own self-tests wrote into the real record. The record has
> since been made injectable (`run_bakeoff(decisions_path=...)`) so a test
> cannot reach this file again. Until a real bakeoff runs, this file is
> EMPTY — and that emptiness is the honest reading: SYSTEM.md's third law
> has never yet been exercised on a real question.
