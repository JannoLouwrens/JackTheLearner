# REVIEW_QUEUE — findings routed to the weekly Review, with their staleness bills

Created 2026-08-24 per the 27th overseer audit's B2: "routed to Review" was a
phrase in commit messages and docstrings with no file, so the backlog was
invisible — nothing could print "3 routed, 0 acted on, oldest 4 days".

**The contract.** One `ROUTED:` row per finding, machine-greppable
(`grep '^ROUTED:' docs/REVIEW_QUEUE.md`). Fields, pipe-separated:
`ROUTED: <id> | <date routed> | <source commit> | <status>` followed by an
indented body: the one-line question and the **staleness bill** — the ledger
rows that acting on it would invalidate. The Review dispositions a row by
setting its status (`OPEN` → `ACTED <date> <commit>` or `DECLINED <date>
<why>`); rows are never deleted (T1.02 precedent: history stays). The bill is
the price of the fix, computed BEFORE deciding, so "fix the world" decisions
are made with the re-certification cost on the table, not discovered after.

Two bills per world-touching row, and they differ: the SEMANTIC bill (rows
whose measured behaviour actually changes) and the MECHANICAL bill (every
PASS row whose `impl_sha` hashes the edited file — all of these go stale
loudly at the next `run status` regardless of semantics, and a dynamics
change has no `--doc-only` lane). As of 2026-08-24, 21 PASS certificates
cite `playground.py` in IMPL_DEPS: BA.01, LC.02, PG.1–PG.6, PG.8, PG.9,
PS.01–PS.03, SM.01, T2.03, T2.08, T2.20, T3.01, TA.01, VO.01, XL.00.

ROUTED: recipe-sensitivity | 2026-08-20 | probe jack-ladder-1787249890 | OPEN
    Question: no single uniform training recipe trains all six matched-param
    UB.10 arms (warmup@1e-3 leaves A2/A3 dead; 3e-4 fixes A3 but breaks A4);
    A2 learned its marginals under NO tested recipe. Per-arm recipes, arm
    redesign, or drop the uniform-recipe constraint? UB.10 is PARKED on this.
    Full record: PROBE RECORD in ub_10_fusion_bakeoff.py; 23rd audit B3.
    Staleness bill: NONE — UB.10 has no PASS and no certificate cites its
    arms. This is the cheapest row to act on.

ROUTED: ne01-occlusion-knife-edge | 2026-08-24 | 5063144 | OPEN
    Question: the 9-ray head-cone occlusion law yields knife-edged ninths a
    sleeping ragdoll cannot hold — the statically-found 0.5–0.9 band realises
    occ 0.337±0.467 overnight (slides out and freezes, or seals and cooks).
    Grade the cone, widen the band geometry, or damp the sleeper? All three
    are runnable arms — this is a redesign BAKEOFF, not an argument.
    Full record: FAIL RECORD in ne_01_nobody_survives_by_accident.py.
    Staleness bill: SEMANTIC — no PASS certificate yet cites the occlusion
    law (NE.01 itself is FAIL); MECHANICAL — the 21 playground.py rows above
    if the fix edits playground.py.

ROUTED: water-apply-phantom-force | 2026-08-24 | a210b34 | OPEN
    Question: Water.apply (playground.py:627) writes a body's xfrc row only
    while it is in the pool, so any body that exits keeps its last buoyancy/
    drag force forever — a phantom force in live dynamics, found by DP.05's
    fidelity pilot (snapshot/restore made it visible). Fix the world?
    Full record: LESSONS d1bc3d1; DP.05 PILOT RECORD.
    Staleness bill: SEMANTIC (worlds with a pool, per the 27th audit) —
    BA.01, LC.02, PS.02, PS.03, XL.00 — 5 PASS certificates; MECHANICAL —
    all 21 playground.py rows above.

ROUTED: w0-too-shallow | 2026-08-24 | 78699b9 | OPEN
    Question: three independent instruments now measure W0 as too shallow to
    reward the capabilities the ladder certifies — LC.03's darkroom control
    (passivity prospers), LC.03 v2 (one learner in five), DP.05 (lookahead
    buys 13–21 s under the 20 s margin; deeper lookahead buys LESS; the best
    reactive policy is "starve at the resting ceiling"). The pre-registered
    routing: traps, delays, irreversibility — the DP.00 preconditions GOAL.md
    names — before any dual-process claim; BO.01 does not run. COUPLED to
    D10 branch (b) in DECISIONS_NEEDED.md (owner) — the Review designs, the
    owner sequences.
    Full record: D10 + its 08-24 evidence update; FAIL RECORD in
    dp_05_lookahead_pays_in_w0.py.
    Staleness bill: depends on the design — a new-world spec (W1, T1.02
    strengthen-only precedent) bills NOTHING; editing W0's playground.py
    bills the 21 rows above. That asymmetry is itself design input.
